Yellow Pages vs White Pages

Yellow pages return categories, white pages return people
Example is the taverna:
You can search for all the heroes in the taverna (white page)
Or for specific hero classes (yellow pages)

Question:
There are diﬀerent communicaton pattern to choose from when designing distributed
systems such as Client-Server, Token-Ring, Broadcast, Blackboard and Peer-to-Peer.

Match adequate communicaton patern to the communicaton between the following
enttes as they are implemented in this scenario. Brieﬂy explain your choice. Be careful, just
because the service is called Blackboard does not mean it used with a Blackboard
communicaton patern.
• Player/Heroservice – Blackboard
• Everyone – Blackboard (discovery)
• Player/Heroservice – Player/Heroservice
• Player/Heroservice – Locaton
• Quest giver – Player
It might be that not all of those have been discussed within lectures so a brief summary (and
you are welcome to google for more informaton):
Client-Server: Communicaton with two diﬀerent roles on a one-to-many relatonship with
the client as initator, server as waitng and serving partner. Server needs to be known to
clients beforehand and behaves (in the eyes of a client) like a centralized system.
Token-Ring: A token is given from node to node in a fxed order and messages are passed
with this token. Originates from the physical token ring topology. Receivers identfy messages
to them by some form of id and remove it from the token when passing it further.
Broadcast: Messages are send to all network partcipants at the same tme and all receive
the message. Nodes have to determine themselves if the message is interestng by reading
the payload – most of the tme a structured message and there might be some kind of
addressing inside.
Blackboard: An extension of Client-Server model. Communicaton of partcipants is done
over a centralized component actng as a blackboard where messages may be “pinned” to be
found by others. So communicaton between partcipants is asynchronous and indirect.
Communicaton of partcipant and blackboard is done in Client-Server fashion. Ofen this
communicaton patern is known as Message-Queues but queues might be misleading in
some usage patern.
Peer-to-Peer: All partcipants act the same and may directly communicate with each other.
Most of the tme the actual communicaton will be similar as Client-Server but the diﬀerence
is that it is not fxed who acts as the server. In a peer-to-peer network every node may reach
out to every other it knows of.
